Finances are hard.  It's one of the first _adulting_ things everyone has to wrestle with.  So, let's make it easy and automate it.  Over the course of several years, my wife and I have tracked our finances using a forecasting method and had done it all within a spreadsheet.  The time came where I wanted to take this concept and make it mobile using serverless architecture and clean design.

The idea is to take what we know: the transactions that are predictable like mortgage and insurance and just keep track of them against the account balance.  Then take transactions that aren't predictable and try to predict them using seasonality analytics.  Does your electric bill go up in the summer?  Let's predict what it would be and try and account for it.
